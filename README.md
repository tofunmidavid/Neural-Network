# Neural-Network
AI Model
This repository provides a step-by-step guide to building a simple AI model from scratch using PyTorch and a sample dataset. The focus of this project is to show how to preprocess data, define a neural network, train the model, and evaluate its performance.

# Overview
This project walks you through the process of creating a basic AI model for predicting salary based on position level. 
The following steps are involved:
1. Data Preparation: Load and preprocess the sample dataset.
2. Model Building: Define a simple neural network architecture using PyTorch.
3. Training: Train the model using gradient descent optimization.
4. Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance on a test dataset.
5. Visualization: Plot the results to understand the model's predictions.
